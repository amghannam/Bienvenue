# Feedback Lo-Fi Prototype

- UWP might not be best platform to reach target audience. (i.e. not found via Google)
- Compare button was confusing. Users expected compare to highlight differences
  on the existing items on screen.
- Scrolling should vertically should scroll all interfaces concurrently.
  - Scrolling concurrently might be difficult if views are different sizes.
    - Could have an area to view more information.
- Compare should permit highlighting items that differ with subtle color differences
  - Text color/background color
  - Will need the algorthim to use for comparison.
- Instead of including a map or picture at the top, include it as background of the box.
- Allow the ability to swap and reorder countries in the user interface.
  - Have a stationary image with name of country transparently overlaid.
- Example questions for Cortana:
    - "What are the differences in currencies between the United States and Canada?"
    - "Cortana, what are the differences between the US and Canada?"
    - "Cortana, what do I have to consider when developing between the US and Canada?
    - Open, Close, Exit
- _Allow the ability to minimize country/culture information_
- Allow the ability to close out countries as needed
- Maybe have a + and x button to add more countries horizontally.
  - Put in near the top right of last country being compared.
- Include alphabet/character set (if possible)
- Include icons for frequently used stats such as currency, language, population, etc.

Overall interaction was positive for the interface. Users felt it was mostly intuitive, outside of minor
suggestions for the interface. Users liked the ability to reset the user interface if need be. 

Some things that we discussed during our feedback were questions like, "Do you think you would use Cortana
features of this application?" The answers we recieved were all yes.
