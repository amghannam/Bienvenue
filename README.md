## Bienvenue: Helping Designers Design Software 
Bienvenue! This project is a Windows 10 app that makes it easy for designers to learn culture-specific facts about different countries. Want to design an app for Japan but not sure of the Japanese phone number and date formats? Bienvenue is here to help, and you don't have to Google anything to find out! 

## Currently supported countries

The app currently contains data on the following countries:

1. United States
2. Canada
3. Australia
4. Japan
5. France
6. Germany
7. China
8. Jordan
9. United Arab Emirates

More will be added in the future. 

## How to Run

Because the app is unpublished, it is best to import it to Visual Studio and run it from the IDE.
