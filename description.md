Around the World
================

- Potential Users:
    
    The potential user for our application can best
    be explained through a persona. We'll call our
    personal Jony. Jony is an interface designer
    who works at a consulting firm that specializies
    in internationalizing applications. Jony is
    technically adept and is generally a fast learner.

- Pressing Needs:
    
    There's not any cross country unified guidelines
    for software development. There's also not a clear,
    consise way to get at-a-glance information about
    a specific culture to get a rough idea when starting
    development of an application.

This is an oppurtunity because we can create something
that can help software interface designers everywhere
make their work better through education. There is a 
relationship between culture and design and providing
designers with an accessible and convient resource can
help make better software for everyone.
